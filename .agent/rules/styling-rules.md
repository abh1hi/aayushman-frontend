- **Styling Method:** Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling system.
- **Exact Match:** Spacing, font sizes, colors, border radius, and shadows must exactly match the design.
- **Custom CSS:** Only allowed when Tailwind cannot achieve the exact visual result.
- **No Style Drift:** Do not improvise spacing, colors, or typography.
- **Responsive Rules:** Follow the same layout behavior as the design across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
